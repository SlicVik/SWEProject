This project is an airplane reservation system done for our term project. All of the code for the project is location in the Program.cs file in the TesterSharp project.
This program uses .CSV files as its data storage method and uses the command prompt as the output method. To make this program work on your computer, there are 5 Program
class variables at the top of Program that are file pointers that point to the .CSV files. These need to be changed for each user. The .CSV files also must be 
downloaded from this project. They have been filled with sample data to test functionality and see usage.
